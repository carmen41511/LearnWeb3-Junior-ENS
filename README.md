## What is ENS?
ENS (Ethereum Name Service) allows users to replace long, difficult-to-remember wallet addresses with human-readable names. It works similar to DNS, mapping names to cryptographic hashes stored on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Setup
- Register an ENS name for wallet address at app.ens.domains
- Create a Next.js project: npx create-next-app
- Install dependencies: npm install web3modal ethers
- Add UI styles

## Functionality
- Connect to MetaMask using Web3Modal
- Display user's ENS name or wallet address
- Look up ENS records on the backend
- Connected status handling

## Deployment
Deploy the app to Vercel for easy hosting. Sign in with GitHub and select the repository.
